# Installation
1. Run `composer create-project edwinhoksberg/slim-framework-skeleton` in the directory you want to install this app.
3. Navigate to your project url and you should see a 'Hello World' message.

To use CSS and JavaScript, run `npm install` for the build dependencies. 
You can then use `gulp` to compile CSS and JavaScript at the same time, or `gulp css` and `gulp js` to run them separately.

With the command `gulp watch`, you can watch any changes on the css and js folders for changes, and it will automatically compile them.
